<h1 align=center>pkgMatcher</h1>

## What is it?

This is early concept of a project of a Linux package mapper over repositories.

For example: you have created a package for ArchLinux and want to migrate it to Debian. Today you need to manually match dependencies. DepsMatcher will help you solve this problem for you.

It is planned to write this project in Rust.
